## Emotion_Detection_from_text
Emotion Detection from Text using Machine Learning 🎭🔍
This project is an AI-powered Emotion Detection Model that classifies text into different emotions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

# 🚀 Features
✅ Preprocessing & Cleaning: Removes URLs, punctuation, stopwords, and extra spaces
✅ TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text into numerical format with 10,000 features & bigrams
✅ SMOTE Balancing: Handles imbalanced data to improve model performance
✅ RandomForest Classifier: Optimized with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
✅ Real-time Emotion Analysis: Enter a sentence and get the predicted emotion instantly

# 📂 Dataset
The model is trained on the Tweet Emotions Dataset, which contains various emotion-labeled tweets.

# 🛠 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

scikit-learn (ML Model & TF-IDF)

NeatText (Text Cleaning)

Seaborn & Matplotlib (Data Visualization)

SMOTE (imblearn) (Balancing Data)

Joblib (Model Saving & Loading)

# 💡 How It Works?
1️⃣ Load & Clean the Dataset
2️⃣ Convert Text to Features (TF-IDF)
3️⃣ Balance Dataset Using SMOTE
4️⃣ Train & Optimize RandomForest Classifier
5️⃣ Evaluate Performance & Test in Real-time

# 📊 Performance
The optimized model achieves 80%+ accuracy by using feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and dataset balancing.

# 📌 Usage
1️⃣ Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas seaborn neattext scikit-learn imblearn joblib matplotlib
2️⃣ Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python emotion_detection.py
3️⃣ Enter text input to get emotion predictions in real-time!

🧩 Future Improvements
🔹 Deploy the model as an API or Web App
🔹 Implement Deep Learning models like LSTMs/BERT for better accuracy
🔹 Use a larger dataset for better generalization
